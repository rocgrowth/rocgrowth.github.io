Roc_Growth

This is Roc_Growth's prototype homepage, shamelessly using 'Twenty', a site template for HTML5 UP (love your work btw). This site is intended to illustrate what a modern website looks like to RocGrowth, and hopefully inspire some changes in their current version. Rochester is an amazing city filled with opportunity for start-ups. There are tons of researchers, engineers and scientists at our world-class universities looking to create the next big thing - all they need is a little structure. Roc_Growth is the structure they need, so let's help bring these folks together.
